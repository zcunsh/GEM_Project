# GEM Project
Welcome to the **GEM project**. There are the documents, floating and fixed-point algorithms, and Verilog codes for the projects.

-------------------

##1. What is GEM?

**GEM** is a serial of development on communication, digital signal processing and image processing etc., in order to train the engineering behaviors for university students. For more information, connect to the project members.

##2. Who can join the projects?
It is an open and global project and everyone interested in can join into the projects.

As the engineering background, the training on electronic engineering, especially signal and system, and digital single processing, and digital logic design, and Verilog language, will be very helpful.

Technically, the working languages in the projects will be English (recommended) and Chinese. Other language is welcome, but the documents in English and/or Chinese should be included.

##3. What tools are necessary?
There is no official tool for the project. 

Although **GEM** is assigned as software, platform and device free, there are some tools recommended. 

The research and simulation on algorithms, in **GEM** group, is based on MATLAB.

 And the Verilog synthesis verification one is Quartus II by Altera.
 
The simulation tool will be Modelsim, whether Altera Version or SE one.

But there is no tool provided by the project, the member should get the copy-rights of their software individually.

##4. Whether is demo-board/development-board necessary?
There is not special hardware necessary for the projects, either.

All of the interfaces and IP components, such as RAM/ROM and FIFO, will be designed as visual ones.

The real systems on board are encouraged. It will be high evaluated for the documents to present such practices.

##5. Is it open-resource?
Definitely, it is an open-resource project which are developed by global engineers.

The license as *GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE* for the codes, details in the file named ' *GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE.txt*', will be followed.

The copyright for documents will be reserved by the certain writers.

The descriptions for projects processing and stories, on media and publications, are assigned to Garfield(mail: <ipcore_garfield@sina.com>), includes but not limited as blogs, books, and journals.

##6. Which codes will be introduced into the main stream?
Separately developing is allowed for every module and the 'best' codes will be introduced into the main steam. 

Those codes should followed the code laws, especially at least 40% comments in the file, and description document on the details in the code to help others to understand. All the comments in the code should be in English. And the history information is mandatory, also.

For those not in the main branch, they are also good references to the new comers.
